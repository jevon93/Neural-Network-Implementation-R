##One customer has generated $250,000 in revenue, wow
##In addition to this data was examined in Excel, where the two corrupted columns were found


```{r}
##Days Since Last order column is wrong - it has been increased by a factor of 24
##Average Discount Used column in wrong - it has also been increased by a factor of 10000

icon$average_discount_used <- icon$average_discount_used/10000

##Sometimes simple is best. Number of male or female items is the most logical way we have to infer gender
##K-means was not doing a good job of splitting by gender
icon2$gender <- ifelse(icon2$male_items > icon2$female_items, "Male", "Female")
```

##Adding a couple new features to data

```{r}
icon2$propmale<- icon2$male_items/(icon2$male_items+icon2$female_items+0.0000001)
icon2$propfemale<- icon2$female_items/(icon2$male_items+icon2$female_items+0.0000001)
icon2$timerev2<-icon2$revenue/(icon2$days_since_first_order+1)
icon2$propdiscount<-icon2$coupon_discount_applied/(icon2$revenue+1)

icon2[is.na(icon2)] <- 0
