4. We want to run an email campaign promoting a new mens luxury brand. Can you provide a list of customers we should send to?
--Question - Do we want to target all people who purchase male items, only those who purchase over a certain amount, 
--or those who subscribe to the newsletter and purchase majority male items?

--and spent over $1000 would be interest
